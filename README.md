# ‚öΩ About this project

This project was inspired by the World Cup atmosphere, and it has one purpose - to bet with your friends.

First, you must create or join a poll to place your bet. Then you can start making your guesses about each game of the World Cup.

To keep your guesses on track, sign into the mobile application using your Google account.

This application is divided in three parts: the server, web, and mobile app.

 ### How to run it?

Clone the repository to your machine.

Enter on server folder:
```bash
$ cd server
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

We need to save the records in the database, so in order to do it correctly, check the .env file wich contains the URL for the database file connection. We are using SQLite. 

```env
$ DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
```

Change it to the database you want to connect. After that, it's time to run the migration:

```bash
$ npx prisma migrate dev
```

If the configuration is ready and connected to the database, let's start the application:
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

### API routes

Inside server folder, there is a file called `Insomnia-nlw-copa.json`. This file contains all the requests provided by the API.

You can import it on Insomnia and it's ready.
